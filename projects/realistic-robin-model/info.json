    "title":"Robin Model",
    "description":"This was my first proper rigged model. At the time, I had bought a vr headset and wanted to play a game called VRChat. In the game each person has it's own avatar whose movements match those of the player, like in a sci-fi movie. My first thought was that I didn't have an avatar, and I didn't want to use one of the thousands available like a normal person. So I spent 2 weeks learning to model, rig and import an avatar using blender.\n Although I didn't model it from scratch, the base model wasn't rigged, and it's topology was far from the best. I modified some geometry, created a skeleton, weight painted it, and added expressions to the character using shape keys. After all that, I imported Robin into unity, set up the bones with some even having physics, and added fun details like being able to toggle between having the hood on the head or hanging and being able to throw a smoke bomb.\n With the amount of time this whole process took, my only wish was that the model looked slightly higher res. After a month or so, I got my eyes on a similar game, Resonite. I took this as my chance to make the robin I had originally dreamed of, so I got to work once again. I uv mapped and painted the character in a new art-style, completely remade the hair and gave him more exaggerated expressions.\n Overall, I am very proud of how it came out."
